Implement vstamps as maps

logger_id {
    aid,
    tid,
    vid
}

map logger_ids to vector_timestamps

entity {
    aid, // actor-id
    tid, // thread-id
    nid, // node-id
    vid  // vector-id
}

send sending entity along with that entities vector_timestamp
on sending

Only include the requiered entries in the vector timestamp

Make it more like the custom_caf-vec application.
Make it so that ShiViz accepts the log files generated.

Fix failing CAF tests
